# What

A cart to start and maybe more later.

# Why

For the [Eggplant Podcast Community Game Jam][] to start with and then
maybe more. Now seemed like a good a time as any to play about with
[PICO-8][], it is most nifty.

# Carts

* `voidseeker.p8` — Void Seeker is an attempt at a game about "Going
  into the Void", but really it's a basic exploration of how to make
  PICO-8 go. Now available [on itch.io](https://broquaint.itch.io/void-seeker).
* `gofastedeliverthings.p8` — An entry for [Eggjam 2][], now available
  on [itch.io](https://broquaint.itch.io/go-fast-deliver-things).
* `trig.p8` — An exploration of trigonometric functions of PICO–8.
* `scratch.p8` — The closest thing I have to a REPL.
